Structural analysis pipeline for longitudinal T1w images in beagles  

This code was used to generate the results in the paper: Age-related brain atrophy and the positive effects of behavioral enrichment in middle-aged beagles, Journal of Neuroscience (2024). [(DOI)](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2366-23.2024)

The cortical gyrus atlas used in this project was created from combining subregions defined in the stereotactic cortical atlas developed by [Johnson et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61665-0)
